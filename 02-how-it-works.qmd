This is a Quarto file with the extension `.qmd`.
You can open it [here](https://rstudio.cloud/project/3519977) on RStudio Cloud.

![](images/penquins-meet-quarto.png){fig-alt="RStudio IDE with a Quarto document titled \"Hello Quarto!\" open on the left side and a blank viewer pane on the right side."}

The source code (on the left) looks very similar to the rendered output (on the right) since we are viewing the file in the [visual editor](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/).
Switching to the source editor reveals the plain text source code underlying the document.

Notice that the file contains three types of content:

-   An (optional) YAML header surrounded by fences comprised of three dashes (`---`):

![](images/yaml.png){fig-alt="YAML of the of the linked example document titled \"Penguins, meet Quarto!\", with annotation that reads \"YAML\"." width="700"}

-   R code chunks identified with `{r}` with (optional) chunk options, in YAML style, identified by `#|` at the beginning of the line:

![](images/chunk.png){fig-alt="The first code chunk of the of the linked example document titled \"Penguins, meet Quarto!\", with annotation that reads \"Code chunk\"." width="700"}

-   Text with formatting, including section headers, hyperlinks, an embedded image, and an inline code chunk:

## Rendering output

Use the ![](images/render.png){width="60"} (**Render**) button in the RStudio IDE to render the file and preview the output with a single click or keyboard shortcut (⇧⌘K).

If you prefer to automatically render whenever you save you can check the **Render on Save** option on the editor toolbar.
The preview will update whenever you re-render the document.
Side-by-side preview works for both HTML and PDF output.

When rendering, Quarto generates a new file that contains selected text, code, and results from the .qmd file.
The new file can be an [HTML](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html), [PDF](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html), [MS Word](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) document, [presentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/), [website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), [book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/), [interactive document](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/), or [other format](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/all-formats.html).

You can also render the document using the functions from the [**quarto**](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-r) package, which provides an R interface to the Quarto CLI:

```{r}
#| eval: false

quarto::quarto_render()
```

## Notebook interface

When you open the file in the RStudio IDE, it becomes a notebook interface for R.
You can run each code chunk by clicking the ![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/18153fb9953057ee5cff086122bd26f9cee8fe93/3aba9/images/notebook-run-chunk.png) icon.
RStudio executes the code and displays the results either inline within your file or in the Console.

## How it works

When you render a Quarto document, first [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and its output.
This markdown file generated is then processed by [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which creates the finished format.
The Render button encapsulates these actions and executes them in the right order for you.\
